# Diarysta

Diarysta is a diary web application that let's you track your daily moods and 
activities and get a graphical summary of your personal diary-stats. You can create 
diary entries in which you specify your mood by selecting the corresponding emoji, 
pick from a selection of activities and write a personal note with the entry. 
You can then have a look at the stats page, where a couple of charts show you how your
mood developed over a specified span of time, what activities you've done when, 
and how they correlate with your mood. You can select one of three languages in the menuEnglish, German, and Indonesian. 
Feel free to check out a demo

Note that the hosting instance hibernates after long inactivity, and it may take a few 
seconds for it to wake up and make the app available.

Please note that this a simply a showcase project of mine, which I mostly used to teach myself React. It is really intended for permanent use. Continued hosting and retention of data cannot be guaranteed and the app may be taken down without prior notice.
